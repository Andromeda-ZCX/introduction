# Andromeda - The Web3 Operating System

Welcome to Andromeda, the cutting-edge Layer 1 blockchain that serves as the web3 operating system, proudly backed by Unizen.

## Unizen Overview
Unizen is a cutting-edge operating system for web3 applications that enables users to seamlessly and securely interact with all things web3. It is designed to provide a unified user experience for interacting with various web3 applications and assets, regardless of the underlying blockchain technology. 

Unizen achieves this by integrating a unique, custom-built, cross-chain enabled DEX aggregator and enabling interoperability services through the Unizen Interoperability Protocol (UIP). This allows users to immediately interact with web3 innovations without the hassle and risks involved with third-party bridges and unfamiliar or illiquid exchanges.

With Unizen, users can swap digital assets with the best available prices and move them between any of the supported blockchains as part of the same action. They can also interact with web3 applications hosted on the Unizen platform as operating system modules and have swaps and interoperability operations happen seamlessly in the very same interaction.

Unizen's approach is aimed at simplifying the process of using web3 technologies, making them more affordable and accessible to a wider audience. By leveraging the power of cross-chain interoperability aggregation and decentralized liquidity, Unizen provides users with a secure, reliable, and user-friendly way to participate in the web3 ecosystem.

## Andromeda - A Subsidiary of Unizen

Andromeda is a Layer 1 blockchain featuring advanced cross-chain interoperability mechanisms secured by its consensus protocol. Andromeda supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) runtime, making it fully compatible with EVM smart contracts and ecosystem tools. Andromeda will be secured with the efficient Nominated Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm in a nutshell.

The information presented in this README offers only a concise glimpse into Andromeda's future as a fully interoperable platform, with an emphasis on support for programmable interoperability with Bitcoin and Ethereum. The architecture and patterns are intended to be scalable such that the same interoperability mechanism used to connect Andromeda with Bitcoin can be adapted to support additional blockchains later on.

Bitcoin will exist on Andromeda as a new token, tentatively named “Andromeda Bitcoin” (ABTC), that is fully backed by Bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio. The ABTC token will be minted by facilitators who are granted permission by Andromeda’s governance system via the ABTC smart contract. The goal of the multi-facilitator system is to foster decentralization and innovation in ABTC usage.

As Andromeda progresses, it will include a comprehensive whitepaper outlining its purpose, technology, tokenomics, team, and roadmap. This technical design document serves as the foundation for the whitepaper, ensuring alignment between conceptualization and implementation as the blockchain evolves to meet the demands of the web3 era.
